# 🎥 Python Media Converter Pro

A modern, lightweight, and safe batch media converter built with `Python`. This tool allows you to convert videos and images in bulk using a clean Dark Mode GUI. It converts only data from one type (e.g. only convert `.mov` files) to onother and creates a backup of processed files instead of deleting them, ensuring no data loss.

## ✨ Features

- **🌑 Modern Dark Mode GUI:** Easy on the eyes, built with standard `tkinter` but styled for a professional look.
- **🔄 Batch Processing:** Select a folder and convert hundreds of files at once.
- **🎯 Smart Filtering:** - Choose a specific source format (e.g., only convert `.mov` to `.mp4`) (Or select `* (All)` to convert every supported media file found).
- **🛡️ Non-Destructive Workflow:** Original files are **not** deleted. Upon successful conversion, they are safely moved to a subfolder named `_ERLEDIGT` (Done).
- **📦 Supported Formats:**
  - **Video:** MP4, MOV, WEBM, AVI, MKV, GIF
  - **Image:** JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, HEIC (input only)
